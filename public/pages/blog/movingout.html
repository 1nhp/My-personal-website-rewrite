                <hr>
                    <p>First off im sorry that i haven't been blogging since the first article in quite a while, In this article im going talk about moving out to the other house, this summer till fall (maybe) and why it wasnt a very good choice.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="text-3xl">1. Moving out</h1>
                    <p>As of June 11, at exactly 7pm i had to move out to the other house due to the fact that my parents didn't agree living with my old brother (and why D: ) what not is that it wont affect the website, as its always hosted on vercel.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because i haven't been living on the other house for this long as i can remember 3 years ago, some stuff stopped working home internet doesnt work anymore because whoever the *censor* isp had to literally disable the home internet it was happening since middle 2024</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As well as the refreginator the fridge also just doesnt work but im hoping someone will fix it for me someday this year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="text-3xl">2. Going back to using mobile internet</h1>
                    <p>Just because if the internet stops working someday doesnt mean ITS your life support, but still its very needed for daily work like how could i solve that problem a bug? without internet use a book? who is even distributing those c books in my country? probably nobody.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So because the pesky isp is ignoring us since middle 2024 i had to just switch to mobile internet and live with it for now!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Infact i noticed it did improve a little bit it only takes 2 seconds to load an youtube video it used to take like 6 seconds least its something!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hovewer maybe someday i may connect home internet as i first find a reliable ISP of course.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="text-3xl">3. The Garden and why i might get too busy</h1>
                    <p>The crops in the other house as it seems the territory for it is quite big! even bigger that it was, on my brothers house, but because of that i will need to help with crops, thus making myself be busy, i know life isnt easy but i must take the chores with a grain o' salt.</p>
                    <p>In most cases i sometimes will have to help collecting cherries etc, but thats how my semi animal life really is.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="text-3xl">FAQ 1. What will happen to Mario Bash?</h1>
                    <p>Because as i have said before i may have lesser free time that i used to, on my older brother house, as even if mobile internet did became quite a bit better thankfully, i will make 1.3 so dont worry much.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This might not be related to the article and topic, but im working on another project on GMS2 about trying to recreate the Nintendo Switch 1 Home menu, as best as i ever could</p>my
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="text-3xl">4. Some good news i found my archlinux usb stick!</h1>
                    <p>In Spring of 2025 i noticed that my archlinux usb flash drive was missing, and i saw that someone took it out for no reason at all</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This might be similar how my Laptop got taken from me back in fall 2023 and why i called late 2023 The Depression Quartal.</p>
                    <p>Dont judge but hard really hard time recovering myself from that not being able to play Switch games on my old pc just because its gpu is *censor* is old and had no opengl 4.6 support was diabolical for me (at least) </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've been trying to find the usb stick and forgot about it really as its been a month and still couldn't find it, thats still i go to the other house and it was wrapped and took it out couldn't be happier!
                    <br>
                    <p>And if your wondering... this caused me to be insanely cautious and careful to not break arch as if i did though e.g f#cking up entire partition i would have to send my laptop to an repair center before i could even find the usb,</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a sidenote i may do a Perspective on Windows 10 and go back ok just freaking kidding i absolutely wont eww im fine with linux god bless torvalds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And thats pretty much it i wrote this at 9pm because someone woke up me for no reason and i supposed to be sleeping at 7pm and woke up at 5am HOW dissapointed i was.</p>
                    <p>But anyway thats it hopefully i will manage to write another article in a.. next month perhaps.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="text-3xl">But wait how about your home server??</h1>
                    <p>cant access it anymore rest in peace</p>
                    <p>May just as well try to use usb as a backup disk</p>
