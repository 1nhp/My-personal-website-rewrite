                    <p>So, recently i've been noticing that my current website, code is a mess!</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="box-border w-150 bg-neutral-800 border-2 overflow-hidden border-neutral-500 rounded-2xl">
                        <img src="/images/screenshots/personal-site.png">
                        <p class="text-center">Whos maintaining such html code:sob:</p>
                    </div><br>

                    <p>So i decided to downright just try and rewrite it on TailWind CSS.</p>
                    <p>But the problem was...</p><br>
                    <p>Github pages simply doesn't support running npm as even if i barely know anything about node (thanks to google for helping me to set up TailWind CSS and maybe npm)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So all i had to do is hope i was unbanned on Vercel! an platform i heard before.</p>
                    <div class="box-border w-90 bg-neutral-800 border-2 overflow-hidden border-neutral-500 rounded-2xl">
                        <img class="w-90" src="/images/screenshots/vercel-ban.png">
                        <p class="text-center">Wowza!</p>
                    </div><br>                                    

                    <p>Little did i know i could slip through the cracks? guess not! you cant just easily register on Vercel without showing your blood and sweats on their email!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because of that Bias i had to email them:</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="box-border w-90 bg-neutral-800 border-2 overflow-hidden border-neutral-500 rounded-2xl p-2">
                        <p>Hello vercel i tried registering an vercel account using your service i had to contact you
                        because i can't make an vercel account by using my main github account i've had this problem since 2 months ago i have no idea is it the country issue or that you cant just register without showing proof of work thanks!</p>
                    </div><br>
                    <p>And they replied with:</p><br>
